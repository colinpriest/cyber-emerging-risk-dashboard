      "description": "Recent reports indicate a significant uptick in phishing attacks that are now being enhanced by Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI technologies are being employed to create more sophisticated phishing emails which mimic genuine communications effectively, making them harder to detect by both traditional security measures and unwary users. These enhanced phishing attempts are more likely to deceive users, leading to unauthorized access and significant data breaches.",

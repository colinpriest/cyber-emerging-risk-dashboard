  "board_summary": "Our analysis has identified three critical emerging cyber risks. First, AI-enhanced phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated, using artificial intelligence to create harder-to-detect threats. Secondly, ransomware attackers are increasingly exploiting new software vulnerabilities, taking advantage of the window before patches are applied. Lastly, the healthcare sector is facing a rise in targeted attacks, leading to significant concerns over data security and patient privacy. These evolving cyber threats require our urgent attention and adaptation of our cyber defense strategies to mitigate risks effectively."
